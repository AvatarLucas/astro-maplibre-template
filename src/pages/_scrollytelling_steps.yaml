    The points you see are known as a dot density map.  
    Each one represents a 1:100 ratio of perished New Orleanians
    and are randomly placed within the grounds of the site.
    This yields a visual cue to the density in each plot and
    is directly tied to age and wealth within NOLA.

  description: Founded in 1823, St. Louis Cemetery No. 2 was originally designed to replace No. 1, but the earlier cemetery was never closed. Using a more formal layout, it was originally one plot running from Canal St to St. Louis St, but was carved up into 4 blocks by the city for Iberville, Bienville and Conti Streets. The church sold the block nearest Canal in 1846 and it has remained three blocks ever since.
