    The points you see are known as a dot density map.  
    Each one represents a 1:100 ratio of perished New Orleanians
    and are randomly placed within the grounds of the site.
    This yields a visual cue to the density in each plot and
    is directly tied to age and wealth within NOLA.

  description: Founded in 1823, St. Louis Cemetery No. 2 was  designed to replace No. 1, but the earlier cemetery was never closed. Originally one plot, it was carved up into 4 blocks for Iberville, Bienville and Conti Streets. The church sold the block nearest Canal in 1846. Using Uber's H3 hexagonal hierarchical spatial system and data from UPenn's Dead Space surveys in 2014, we can accurately represent density in 3D.

  description: The square to the South has different density of burials for a reason. The first to accept African Americans, a network of "society tombs" sprung up to service the needs of minorities and the poor in death. Today, most organizations are defunct, but preservationists have teamed up with Craftspeople to restore these tombs in the hope to tell this important history of Creole culture.
